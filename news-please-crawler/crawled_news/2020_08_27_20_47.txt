    "maintext": "Joe Biden and Kamala Harris stepped up their criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he\u2019s rooting for violence amid unrest in Wisconsin and blasting him for a lack of leadership on the coronavirus pandemic, hours before Trump\u2019s planned address on the final night of the Republican National Convention.\n\u201cHe views this as a political benefit,\u201d Democratic presidential nominee Biden said on MSNBC about protests in Wisconsin after police shot a Black man earlier this week. \u201cHe\u2019s rooting for more violence, not less. And it\u2019s clear about that.\u201d\nHarris, the vice-presidential nominee, said Trump has showed \u201ca reckless disregard for the well-being of the American people\u201d in failing to contain the coronavirus. It was her first major Trump-focused speech since she joined the Democratic ticket.\nStory continues below advertisement\n2:18 Trump\u2019s acceptance speech expected to target Biden Trump\u2019s acceptance speech expected to target Biden\nThe two had been largely silent during the first three days of the GOP convention, during which Republicans have tried to link them to protesters, warning a Biden presidency would make America less safe and erroneously saying he wants to defund the police.\nMeanwhile, the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has once again sparked protests against racial injustice and police brutality. Days later, a 17-year-old white gunman was arrested in connection with the shooting deaths of two protesters in clashes between vigilante militias and protesters.\n2:00 RNC aims to fire up Trump fans, not attract new voters RNC aims to fire up Trump fans, not attract new voters\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway suggested on Fox & Friends that the Wisconsin unrest could help Trump\u2019s reelection chances.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\u201cThe more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns,\u201d Conway said, \u201cthe better it is for the very clear choice on who\u2019s best on public safety and law and order.\u201d\nBiden does not support defunding the police but has advocated for overhauling U.S. police practices after years of high-profile killings of Black Americans by officers. Harris, meanwhile, sponsored a bill in Congress to ban certain police practices like chokeholds and no-knock warrants and would create a national registry for police misconduct, among other things.\nRead more: Key takeaways from Day 3 of the Republican National Convention\nIn Washington Thursday, Harris offered her support for protesters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder people are taking to the streets \u2014 and I support them,\u201d she said. \u201cMake no mistake: We will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to justice.\u201d\nHer comments are likely to fuel Republican criticism on the convention\u2019s final night and mark a stark contrast with Republican Vice-President Mike Pence\u2019s remarks Wednesday, when he praised police and slammed protesters he deemed violent. He did not mention Blake or other Black Americans killed by police this year, nor directly reference the teenager arrested in connection to the killing of two protesters.\n1:18 President Trump\u2019s daughter Tiffany says media \u2018manipulates\u2019 Americans in RNC address President Trump\u2019s daughter Tiffany says media \u2018manipulates\u2019 Americans in RNC address\n\u201cLet me be clear: The violence must stop \u2014 whether in Minneapolis, Portland or Kenosha,\u201d Pence said, after warning people they would not be safe in Biden\u2019s America.\nStory continues below advertisement\nMeanwhile Biden, who has largely limited travel to near his home in Wilmington, Delaware, during the pandemic said he\u2019d consider travelling to Kenosha himself.\n\u201cIf I were president I\u2019d be going,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to tell now what the circumstance on the ground is.\u201d\nShould he make the trip, Biden said, he would attempt to \u201cpull together the Black community as well as the white community and sit down and talk about how we get through this.\u201d\nOf Trump, he said: \u201cThis is his America now. And, if you want to end where we are now, we\u2019ve got to end his tenure as president.\u201d\nHarris focused her speech on Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, which has shuttered much of the U.S. economy for months and killed more than 170,000 Americans. She accused Trump of incompetence that has \u201cbecome deadly\u201d while painting Biden as a president who would address the pandemic seriously. She criticized Republicans for not painting a clearer picture of the pandemic\u2019s toll during their convention, saying Trump has failed to protect the well-being and safety of Americans.\n4:32 Teen involved in Lincoln Memorial confrontation slams media \u2018war machine\u2019 at RNC Teen involved in Lincoln Memorial confrontation slams media \u2018war machine\u2019 at RNC\nIt\u2019s typical for a vice-presidential running mate to serve as the primary critic of the opponent, and Harris\u2019s speech demonstrated how she\u2019ll handle that role. A former prosecutor, her standout moments that have energized Democrats during the Trump presidency have come during her pointed questioning of his administration nominees. Now, she\u2019s likely to turn that fire on Trump.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\u201cBefore this virus hit, Trump made our country vulnerable,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter it struck, he failed to do what was necessary. As it continues he\u2019s making it worse everyday.\u201d\n1:03 Kamala Harris says Trump has shown \u2018reckless disregard\u2019 for well-being of Americans Kamala Harris says Trump has shown \u2018reckless disregard\u2019 for well-being of Americans",

    "maintext": "OTTAWA -- An opportunity to test a potential COVID-19 vaccine in Canadian clinical trials is now \"over\" because Chinese customs did not approve it for shipment to Canada, according to the National Research Council (NRC).\nThe NRC confirmed to CTV News on Thursday that CanSino Biologics \"does not have the authority\" from the Chinese government to ship the Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate \"at this time.\"\n\"Due to the delay in the shipment of the vaccine doses to Canada it is evident this specific opportunity is over and the NRC is focusing its team and facilities on other partners and COVID-19 priorities,\" reads the emailed statement from the NRC.\nHeadquartered in Tianjin, China, CanSino signed an agreement with the NRC in May. After Health Canada's review and approval, the Canadian Center for Vaccinology was preparing to start clinical trials as early as June, but progress came to a standstill after Canadian authorities said the Chinese government was stalling the shipment process.\n\"The agreement between the NRC and CanSino was reviewed prior to signature by CanSino\u2019s collaborators in the Chinese Government \u2013 the Beijing Institute of Technology and the Ministry of Science and Technology \u2013 who had provided funding to CanSino,\" the statement says.\n\"Subsequent to signing, the Government of China introduced process changes regarding shipping vaccines to other countries. The process is not clear to the NRC.\"\nCanSino Biologics did not respond to CTVNews.ca\u2019s request for comment at the time this story was published.\nThe Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate has already been sent to other countries including Russia, Chile, Argentina, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia for Phase 3 trials or large-scale testing on humans.\nHuman trials of the vaccine candidate are also in Phase 3 in China, with results promising enough that the Chinese government has approved it for use in its military. The vaccine was one of the first in the world to enter the second phase of human clinical trials after it presented no major safety issues.\nNormally, testing a vaccine can take five to seven years, but the anticipated Canadian clinical trials were expected to be fast-tracked through typical regulatory hurdles due to the urgency of the pandemic.\nCanSino's vaccine was developed using a cell line from the NRC that was previously used to produce an Ebola vaccine. The two organizations have worked together since 2013.\nMeanwhile, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne downplayed suggestions that the vaccine partnership failed because of ongoing political tensions between Canada and China.\n\"I don't necessarily think so,\" Champagne told reporters Thursday. \"I can only speak for the Canadian side. I would not necessarily link whether that particular opportunity is linked to anything else.\"\nRelations have been tense since the Chinese detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in apparent retaliation for the RCMP's arrest of Chinese tech executive Meng Wanzhou on an American extradition warrant in December 2018.\nDr. Scott Halperin, director of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology, added that losing access to the vaccine may set Canada back in the fight against COVID-19.\n\"The CanSino vaccine is one of the most furthest along of any of the candidate vaccines so it would have been nice to do that study,\" Halperin said. \"It's not the only vaccine that we are working with ... but we certainly don't like to lose access to any one of them because we need multiple vaccines.\"\nHe notes that had his lab received the vaccine its study would have been \"well along by now.\"\n\"We thought the shipment would be coming any day, as did the company,\" he said. \"There was no bad faith on the company -- they were trying everything but they could not get (Chinese) government approval to ship it. The request for shipment hasn't been denied it just hasn't been approved.\"\nClinical pharmacologist Sabina Vohra-Miller says handing over that kind of asset without securing intellectual property rights on the vaccine was a major missed opportunity for Canada.\n\"This is a miss because you wouldn\u2019t have that by-product if you didn\u2019t have that foundational system of the cell line,\" she told CTV News.ca.\n\"We\u2019re trying to be the noblest citizens in terms of advancing science and making sure that there is no gatekeeping with that, and you would expect that there would be a reciprocity on that.\"\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters several contracts are in the works to ensure Canada gets early access to potential COVID-19 vaccines.\n\"We\u2019ve actually signed a number of deals with potential vaccine producers around the world. The issue is nobody yet has a vaccine and nobody knows who\u2019s going to develop the vaccine so like many, many countries around the world, we\u2019re working with a range of partners to ensure that when someone does find a vaccine Canadians will have access to it.\"\nThe Canadian government also announced in May that it was planning a $44-million upgrade to a NRC facility in Montreal to prepare for the possibility of a large-scale Ad5-nCoV manufacturing effort should human trials be successful.\nWhile multiple trials around the world are progressing, there is currently no accepted cure or vaccine for the novel coronavirus.\nWith files from CTVNews.ca\u2019s Solarina Ho and the Canadian Press",

    "maintext": "Prosecutors on Thursday charged a 17-year-old from Illinois in the fatal shooting of two protesters and the wounding of a third in Kenosha, Wis., during a night of unrest following the weekend police shooting of Jacob Blake.\nKyle Rittenhouse faces one count of first-degree intentional homicide, one count of first-degree reckless homicide, one count of attempted first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment. He would face a mandatory life sentence if convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, the most serious crime in Wisconsin.\nThe attack late Tuesday \u2014 largely caught on cellphone video and posted online \u2014 and the shooting by police Sunday of Blake, a 29-year-old Black father of six who was left paralyzed from the waist down, made Kenosha the latest focal point in the fight against racial injustice that has gripped the country since the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.\nThe two men who were killed were Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, and Anthony Huber, 26, of Silver Lake, Wis., about 25 kilometres west of the city. The wounded person, Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, of West Allis, about 50 kilometres northwest of Kenosha, was expected to survive, police said.\nUnder Wisconsin law, anyone 17 or older is treated as an adult in the criminal justice system.\nPolice questioned\nWhile the investigation into the shooting of Blake proceeded on one track, Kenosha police faced questions about their interactions with the gunman the night of the killings. According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the gunman walk past them and leave the scene with a rifle over his shoulder and his hands in the air as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people.\nWATCH | The gunman is seen walking, unimpeded, past police cars in Kenosha, Wis.:\nGunfire erupted overnight at a protest in support of Jacob Blake, who was shot several times during an encounter with police in Kenosha, Wis., and remains in hospital. 1:00\nAs for how the gunman managed to slip away, Sheriff David Beth described a chaotic, high-stress scene, with lots of radio traffic and people screaming, chanting and running \u2014 conditions he said can cause \"tunnel vision\" among law officers.\nVideo taken before the shooting shows police tossing bottled water from an armoured vehicle and thanking armed civilians walking the streets. One of them appears to be the gunman.\nRittenhouse's attorney, Lin Wood, said the teenager was acting in self-defence. Cellphone footage shows the shooter being chased into a used car lot by someone before shots are heard and the person lies dead. The shooter then runs down the street where he is chased by several people shouting that he just shot someone. He stumbles after being approached by several more people and fires, killing another man and injuring a third.\n\"From my standpoint, it's important that the message be clear to other Americans who are attacked that there will be legal resources available in the event false charges are brought against them,\" he said. \"Americans should never be deterred from exercising their right of self-defence.\"\nThe national and state chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday called for the resignation of Beth and Kenosha Police Chief Dan Miskinis over their handling of Blake's shooting and the subsequent protests.\nWATCH | Kamala Harris calls the shooting of Jacob Blake 'sickening':\nVice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris says the shooting of Jacob Blake pierced the soul of her nation. 0:39\nShot in the back\nBlake was shot in the back seven times Sunday as he leaned into his SUV, in which three of his children were seated.\nOn Wednesday \u2014 three days after the shooting \u2014 state authorities identified the officer who shot Blake as Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the Kenosha Police Department.\nAuthorities said Sheskey was among officers who responded to a domestic dispute, though they have not said whether Blake was part of the dispute. Sheskey shot Blake while holding onto his shirt after officers first unsuccessfully used a Taser, the Wisconsin Justice Department said. State agents later recovered a knife from the floor on the driver's side of the vehicle, the department said. State authorities did not say Blake threatened anyone with the knife.\nBen Crump, the lawyer for Blake's family, said Tuesday that it would \"take a miracle\" for Blake to walk again. He called for the arrest of Sheskey and for the others involved to lose their jobs. State officials have announced no charges.\nBlake's father told the Chicago Sun-Times on Thursday that he was upset to learn his son was handcuffed to his hospital bed.\n\"He can't go anywhere. Why do you have him cuffed to the bed?\" said his father, also named Jacob Blake.\nAt a news conference, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said that Blake has \"paid a horrific price already,\" citing concerns about him being handcuffed.\nStreets quiet Wednesday night\nGroups that had taken to Kenosha's streets with long guns earlier in the week were nowhere to be seen early Thursday following sombre protests and no widespread unrest for the first night since the weekend police shooting of Blake.\nMarchers were solemn during Wednesday night's protests, marching past the intersection where two people were killed Tuesday night, stopping to gather around the spot where one person was shot, and to pray and lay flowers. Daijon Spann said he decided to join the demonstration because one of those killed the night before was a friend.\n\"I couldn't take it any more,\" he said. \"I couldn't just sit there and watch my friend die.\"\nItems are placed at the site of a Tuesday night shooting in Kenosha, Wis., on Wednesday. A 17-year-old from Illinois has been arrested and charged with first-degree intentional homicide. (Morry Gash/The Associated Press)\nThe attack late Tuesday and the shooting by police Sunday of Blake, a 29-year-old Black father of six who was left paralyzed from the waist down, made Kenosha the latest focal point in the fight against racial injustice that has gripped the country since the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.\nIn solidarity, Milwaukee Bucks players refused to play their playoff game Wednesday, temporarily halting the NBA season. Three Major League Baseball games were delayed because players refused to take the field and several NFL teams cancelled their Thursday practices.\nThe basketball court sits empty after a postponed first-round NBA playoff game between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Orlando Magic on Wednesday at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. (Ashley Landis/Pool/The Canadian Press/The Associated Press)\nAlso Thursday, Wisconsin Lutheran College located about 65 kilometres from Kenosha said it cancelled a planned Saturday commencement speech by U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence, citing the unrest.\nThere were no groups patrolling Kenosha's streets with long guns Wednesday night as there had been during previous nights' protests. Protesters also stayed away from a courthouse that had been the site of standoffs with law enforcement. Unlike the previous two nights, when dozens of fires were set and businesses were ransacked and destroyed, there was no widespread unrest.\nEvers authorized the deployment of 500 members of the National Guard to Kenosha, doubling the number of troops in the city of 100,000. Guard troops from Arizona, Michigan and Alabama were coming to Wisconsin to assist, Evers said Thursday. He did not say how many.\nWATCH | Donald Trump credits National Guard with overnight calm:\nPresident Donald Trump credits the National Guard with the more peaceful protests in Kenosha, Wis., Wednesday night. 1:36\nIn Washington, the Justice Department said it was sending in more than 200 federal agents from the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The White House said up to 2,000 National Guard troops would be made available. The Justice Department also announced that the U.S. attorney's office and FBI would conduct a civil rights investigation into the shooting of Blake, in cooperation with Wisconsin state law enforcement agencies.\nMuch of Rittenhouse's Facebook page is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter, a movement that supports police. In photos posted on his page, which has since been locked down, he also can be seen holding an assault rifle. In a photo posted on his mother's page, he is wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform as well as the kind of brimmed hat that state troopers wear.",

    "maintext": "DELCAMBRE, La. - Laura roared toward landfall in southwestern Louisiana near the Texas border as a menacing Category 4 hurricane late Wednesday, raising fears of a 20-foot storm surge that forecasters said would be \u201cunsurvivable\u201d and capable of engulfing entire communities. Ocean water topped by white-capped waves rose ominously as the monster neared.\nAuthorities implored coastal residents of Texas and Louisiana to evacuate, but not everyone did before winds began buffeting trees back and forth in an area that was devastated by Rita in 2005.\nThe storm grew nearly 87% in power in just 24 hours to a size the National Hurricane Center called \u201cextremely dangerous.\u201d Drawing energy from the warm Gulf of Mexico, the system was on track to arrive early Thursday during high tide as the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. so far this year.\n\u201cIt looks like it's in full beast mode, which is not what you want to see if you're in its way,\u201d University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said.\nHurricane-force winds extending 60 miles (95 kilometres) from the storm's centre neared the coast, forecasters said, and bands of heavy rain fell 30 miles (48 kilometres) from the beach in Lake Charles.\nLate Wednesday, Laura was churning about 75 miles (120 kilometres) south of Lake Charles and moving north-northwest at 15 mph (24 kph).\nMaximum sustained winds increased to 150 mph (241 kph) before nightfall, and forecasters said up to 15 inches (38 centimetres) of rain could fall. Forecasters issued a string of tornado warnings as the storm pushed on to land, but there were no immediate reports of damage.\nOne major Louisiana highway already had standing water as Laura's outer bands moved ashore with tropical storm-force winds. Thousands of sandbags lined roadways in tiny Lafitte, and winds picked up as shoppers earlier Wednesday rushed into a grocery store in low-lying Delcambre.\nTrent Savoie, 31, said he was staying put. \u201cWith four kids and 100 farm animals, it's just hard to move out,\u201d he said.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards fretted that the dire predictions were not resonating despite authorities putting more than 500,000 coastal residents under mandatory evacuation orders.\nOfficials said at least 150 people refused pleas to leave and planned to weather the storm in everything from elevated homes to recreational vehicles in coastal Cameron Parish, which could be completely covered by ocean water.\n\u201cIt's a very sad situation,\u201d said Ashley Buller, assistant director of emergency preparedness. \u201cWe did everything we could to encourage them to leave.\u201d\nEdwards activated the state's entire National Guard. In Lake Charles, Guard members drove school buses around neighbourhoods, offering to pick up families. Across the state line in Port Arthur, Texas, few stragglers boarded evacuation buses, and city officials announced that two C-130 transport planes offered the last chance to leave.\nAbbott warned that people who fail to get out of harm's way could be cut off from help long after the storm hit.\nA Category 4 hurricane can render wide areas uninhabitable for weeks or months and knock out power for just as long. The threat of such devastation posed a new disaster-relief challenge for a government already straining under the coronavirus pandemic. The parts of Louisiana that were under evacuation orders included areas turning up high rates of positive COVID-19 tests.\nThe National Hurricane Center kept raising its estimate of Laura's storm surge, from 10 feet (3 metres) just days ago to twice that size - a height that forecasters said would be especially deadly.\nBy Wednesday night, Laura was churning about 90 miles (145 kilometres) south of Lake Charles and moving north-northwest at 15 mph (24 kph).\nOn Twitter, President Donald Trump urged coastal residents to heed officials. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles (322 kilometres). Storm surge warnings extended from Freeport, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.\nFor some, the decision to leave home left them with no place to stay. Wary of opening mass shelters during a pandemic, Texas officials instead put evacuees in hotels, but Austin stopped taking arrivals before dawn because officials said they ran out of rooms. Other evacuees called the state's 211 information line and were directed to Ennis, outside Dallas, only to be told after driving hundreds of miles no hotels or vouchers were available.\nTaniquia Ned and her sisters showed up without money to rent a room, saying the family had burned through its savings after losing jobs because of the coronavirus. \u201cThe COVID-19 is just totally wiping us out,\u201d said Shalonda Joseph, 43, a teacher in Port Arthur.\nEdwards lamented that the impending storm meant suspension of community testing for COVID-19 at a crucial time - as elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana open and students return to college campuses.\nForecasters said storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire towns. Water was already rising in the small Louisiana community of Holly Beach in the imperiled Cameron Parish.\nLaura was expected to cause widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. Flood watches were issued for much of Arkansas, and forecasters said heavy rainfall could arrive by Friday in parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Laura is so powerful that it's expected to become a tropical storm again once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean, potentially threatening the Northeast.\nBecky Clements, 56, evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could take a direct hit. She and her family found an Airbnb hundreds of miles inland. Almost 15 years have passed since Hurricane Rita destroyed the city.\n\u201cThe devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,\u201d Clements recalled. \u201cWhole communities were washed away, never to exist again.\u201d\nThe church educator said she fears for her office, which is in a trailer following recent construction.\n\u201cI very much anticipate that my office will be gone when I get back.\u201d\nThe hurricane also threatened a centre of the U.S. energy industry as the majority of Gulf oil and natural gas production shut down. Consumers are unlikely to see big price hikes, however, because the pandemic has decimated demand for fuel.\nLaura closed in on the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.\nLaura will be the seventh named storm to strike the U.S. this year, setting a new record for U.S. landfalls by the end of August. The old record was six in 1886 and 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.\n--\nMartin reported from Marietta, Georgia, and Plaisance from Stephensville, Louisiana.

    "maintext": "Ontario will build two new jails and upgrade three others as part of a major investment plan to modernize the corrections system in eastern Ontario, Premier Doug Ford said Thursday.\nThe province will replace the existing Brockville Jail \u2014 which opened in 1842 \u2014 with a new facility, and construct a correctional complex on government-owned land in Kemptville, Ont., approximately 60 km south of Ottawa.\nThe money will also fund renovations of the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre and expansions of the St. Lawrence Valley Correctional and Treatment Centre in Brockville and the Quinte Detention Centre in Napanee, Ont.\nIn total, the new builds will add 375 beds, of which 70 will be dedicated for women.\nFord said the extra space will help reduce overcrowding in provincial jails while creating jobs and supporting correctional workers.\n\"These investments will help promote safety, provide additional tools and support and improve the work environment for frontline correctional staff,\" said Ford.\n\"I want our correctional staff to know that we will always have your backs.\"\nThe announcement comes almost three years after Ontario's independent corrections adviser recommended sweeping changes to the way jails are run. Howard Saper's report contained 62 recommendations, including calling for limits on the use of solitary confinement, a better complaints process for inmates and more family visits and supports for people in jail.\nNo word on cost, timeline\nThe government didn't share details on how much the projects will cost in total or a timeline for the completion of each project.\nThe investment will be in addition to a previously-announced $500-million the province plans to spend over the next five years to hire 500 additional corrections staff to help address challenges within the correctional system, such as mental health and addiction issues.\nSmokey Thomas, president of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU), which represents around 9,000 correctional workers, said upgrades to the province's aging facilities and more support for corrections staff are badly needed.\n\"I'm extremely pleased to see the government making good on its plan to fix the crisis in corrections,\" said Thomas. \"Taking practical, meaningful steps to relieve the crisis is long overdue \u2014 and COVID-19 has made solutions even more urgent. I appreciate that the premier has taken the time to sit down with me and listen to advice from the front-line workers that OPSEU represents.\"\nWarren (Smokey) Thomas is president of OPSEU, the Ontario Public Service Employees' Union. (CBC)\nThomas said his union has been lobbying for similar changes for decades.\n\"I impressed upon the premier to please, please listen to the frontline workers when they're doing their designs and [to] take their input to heart because they know how to make it work better,\" Thomas said.\nThere are approximately 6,100 adults in custody in Ontario jails on any given day, according to the province.\nBuilding more jails is 'backwards,' professor says\nJustin Pich\u00e9, a criminology professor at the University of Ottawa who studies incarceration, criticized the investment as \"backwards\" at a time when report after report has identified major flaws in the way the corrections system treats incarcerated people.\n\"We're expanding our capacity to cage people, to criminalize people living with mental health issues,\" said Pich\u00e9. \"It's unfathomable to me and it should be to others that corrections \u2014 a sector that continually fails to live up to its legal standards and obligations, that fails to meet its own objectives \u2014 is rewarded in this way.\"\nPich\u00e9 said that money would be better spent on social supports that would help keep people out of the jail system, including education and housing, and alternatives to jails such as halfway houses.\n\"This government is ... basically paving the road to further injustice and marginalization when we need at this moment to be spending money and capital on taking our societies and our communities to the next level to be able to produce a more inclusive, prosperous, healthy way of life,\" said Pich\u00e9.\nJustin Pich\u00e9, associate professor of criminology at the University of Ottawa, says the Ontario government should spend more money on social supports that prevent people from becoming incarcerated rather than expanding jails. (Submitted by Justin Pich\u00e9)\nAccording to a background document, the new facility in Kemptville \u2014 called the Greater Ottawa Correctional Complex \u2014 will \" adopt modern planning principles and design elements, including single cell occupancy, risk-classified housing units, modern programming and cultural space, open visitation spaces and improved professional development space for staff.\"\nOnce it is complete, the ministry will reassess its plans for the OCDC, which was built in the 1970s. The plan to renovate the OCDC appears to replace a previous announcement in 2017 from the Liberal government of Kathleen Wynne to build a 725-bed jail to replace the current facility. The current capacity of the Ottawa facility is 516, a ministry spokesperson said.\nOCDC has been plagued for years by problems that include overcrowding, lack of proper health care, overuse of solitary confinement and inmates committing suicide.\nThe new Brockville Correctional Complex, which will replace the Brockville Jail, will be built on the grounds of the St. Lawrence Valley Correctional and Treatment Centre. An additional facility that serves women only will be built there as well.\nAt the Quinte Detention Centre, a separate building will be constructed adjacent to the existing facility in Napanee, Ont., much of which will be used for inmate programming and recreational facilities. New living units will be built to house women, which will be single-storey and single occupancy, the document said.",

    "maintext": "The House of Commons law clerk says public servants went too far in redacting the WE Charity documents released to MPs last week \u2014 and warns the cuts may have violated a production order from the finance committee to hand over all internal correspondence related to the summer student grants program.\nThe government released thousands of pages of documents related to the WE matter, as the committee requested last month. But rather than have the independent law clerk redact certain information, such as cabinet confidences and personal information, the various departments responsible for this aborted program did the blackouts themselves \u2014 an apparent contravention of the committee's request.\nThe end result was hundreds of blank pages and blacked-out content \u2014 information only known to the public servants who red-penciled the material.\nThey deliberately ignored the committee's will in order to cover up the truth and protect Justin Trudeau's reputation. - Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre\nThe finance committee requested all memos related to the WE Charity contribution agreement and clearly stipulated that any redactions should be \"made by the Office of the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel of the House of Commons\" \u2014 not government censors.\nLast week, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office told CBC News that the redactions were done by the parliamentary law clerk, who was following the committee's direction to remove documents covered by cabinet confidentiality and personal information about Canadian citizens.\nBut that law clerk, Philippe Dufresne, said in a confidential August 18 letter to the clerk of the finance committee that the vast majority of the blackouts had been done by government bureaucrats \u2014 and some relevant information relating to the $912 million deal with WE may have been withheld, something which could constitute a breach of parliamentary privilege.\nOttawa-based news outlet iPolitics first reported on Dufresne's letter.\nDufresne raised red flags about the redaction process, saying his office did not have a chance to review the written material in its original form as the committee had intended. He also said the redactions his office did were limited to the personal information of public servants working on this file.\n\"The documents had already been redacted by the departments to protect personal information and on other grounds. As my office has not been given the opportunity to see the unredacted documents, we are not able to confirm whether those redactions are consistent with the order of the Committee,\" Dufresne said in his correspondence with David Gagnon, the finance committee clerk.\n\"The departments made certain redactions to the documents on grounds that were not contemplated in the order of the committee. We note that the House's and its committees' power to order the production of records is absolute and unfettered as it constitutes a constitutional parliamentary privilege that supersedes statutory obligations, such as the exemptions found in the Access to Information Act.\"\n(Provisions of the Access to Information Act are commonly used to justify releasing censored material to journalists and the general public.)\n\"The House and its committees are the appropriate authority to determine whether any reasons for withholding the documents should be accepted or not,\" Dufresne added.\nThe opposition parties have said that the documents that have been released so far call into question Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's claim that he first learned that public servants were recommending that WE Charity administer the grants program ahead of a cabinet meeting on May 8.\nEmails released show that senior members of his office \u2014 including Rick Theis, the director of policy and cabinet affairs \u2014 had meetings with the charity about its proposal to administer the program before that date.\nAn April 20 email from Michelle Kovacevic, a senior Finance official, said the \"PMO was weighing in\" on WE's pitch to dole out student support.\nThat same official called senior members of former finance minister Bill Morneau's staff \"besties\" with WE Charity administrators in a May 7 email. Members of Morneau's team were working with WE in April on how best to craft the grants program.\nCraig Kielburger, the co-founder of WE, later thanked Ben Chin, one of Trudeau's senior advisers, in a June LinkedIn message for his \"kindness in helping shape our latest program with the government.\"\nPierre Poilievre, the Conservative finance critic, said today he believes the government directed bureaucrats to hide key information related to this scandal to shield the prime minister from further scrutiny.\n\"They deliberately ignored the committee's will in order to cover up the truth and protect Justin Trudeau's reputation,\" Poilievre said in an interview with CBC. \"The law clerk was tasked with combing through all the material and redacting any cabinet confidence or other information that needed to be kept from public view. Instead, the Trudeau government did its own redacting.\n\"I think the plan, Trudeau's plan, is to try and cover up the facts in this scandal until the fall when he will force an early election, in the hopes that none of this, none of the truth comes to light before Canadians go to the polls. This government, under his direction, is going to such lengths to bury it all until after Canadians vote.\"\nWE Charity co-founders Craig (left) and Marc Kielburger introduce Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau as they appear at the WE Day celebrations in Ottawa, Tuesday November 10, 2015. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)\nAfter Morneau's abrupt resignation on August 17, Trudeau prorogued Parliament until the end of September, shutting down the Commons committees studying the WE matter. The prorogation means the committees are powerless to challenge redactions to the WE documents.\nThe opposition parties will have a chance to vote down the government \u2014 and force an election \u2014 after a Sept. 23 speech from the throne by Gov. Gen. Julie Payette.\nPoilievre said the government should immediately hand over the original documents in question to the law clerk so he can decide what can or cannot be released to parliamentarians.\nA senior government official, speaking on background Thursday, conceded both bureaucrats and the law clerk made amendments to the documents delivered to MPs.\nBut the official said the government released a number of memos to cabinet related to the WE matter \u2014 even though the committee explicitly called for the exclusion of such documents \u2014 as a show of good faith.\nThe PMO referred all questions on the matter to the Privy Council Office (PCO), the arm of government that serves the prime minister and cabinet and coordinates the work of the various federal departments.\nPierre-Alain Bujold, spokesperson for the PCO, side-stepped a question about whether the government would hand over the documents \u2014 in their original state \u2014 for review by the law clerk.\nHe did not say why bureaucrats assumed responsibility for the redactions, despite the committee's order.\n\"Every effort was made to release as much information as possible to the committee, and indeed cabinet confidences pertaining to the Canadian Summer Student Grant program were disclosed,\" Bujold said in a statement.\n\"A limited amount of information was protected.\"\nIn fact, more than a quarter of all the documents provided to the finance committee were redacted in whole or in part.",

We\u2019re united now, we\u2019re going to talk together as a caucus soon,\u201d O\u2019Toole told reporters Tuesday.\nDamoff disagreed with O\u2019Toole, saying she felt many of Sloan\u2019s comments were emblematic of his politics.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say those kind of things just in the heat of the moment during a campaign,\u201d Damoff said.\nOn Thursday, Sloan told Global News in an interview that he feels like many of his goals align with those of the new leader.\n\u201cWe\u2019re united on the need for a new government, we\u2019re united on the need to reign the spending in under control, we\u2019re united on the need to be cautious against communist China in some of their advances in bullying that we see on the national stage,\u201d Sloan said.\n1:37 Newly Elected Conservative MP Derek Sloan faces criticism after posting controversial tweet Newly Elected Conservative MP Derek Sloan faces criticism after posting controversial tweet\nFor his part, Sloan called Damoff\u2019s letter a political attack piece.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\u201cThe timing was such that it was clear that it was a political attack to try to divide the party under its new leadership,\u201d Sloan said.\nSloan said that the items Damoff published were \u201cchoice tidbits,\u201d chosen out of context, and that he didn\u2019t believe she made a concentrated effort to go over his leadership campaign in detail.\n\u201cThe comments that I made are on the public record, and if you look at them, they\u2019re quite thoughtful and articulate, and obviously certain comments were taken out of context, but everything I\u2019ve said has been out in the public view, and I\u2019ve been unapologetic about the views that I have,\u201d Sloan said.\nIn the end, the MP for Hastings \u2014 Lennox and Addington called Damoff\u2019s letter a product of a Liberal electoral strategy.\nWhen asked if Sloan had spoken to O\u2019Toole about the letter, Sloan said that he had spoken to the new leader \u201cseveral times\u201d since he won, but made no mention of Damoff.\nDamoff herself said she has yet to hear a response from O\u2019Toole, but she has received a volume of responses on social media. At first, many were positive, but Damoff says comments have turned ugly.\n\u201cIt has received a lot of response, but also some that are just so disgusting and I\u2019ve stopped looking at it yesterday. We also have started getting a number of voicemails and emails into my office from people,\u201d she said.\nStory continues below advertisement",

    "maintext": "Public health officials in British Columbia provided new information Thursday about where COVID-19 cases have been found in the province and how they are spreading.\nAt a news conference held Thursday in Victoria, the province introduced a new map breaking down the location of COVID-19 cases within each of B.C.'s health authorities.\nB.C. Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix also reported 68 new cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, as well as one more death, a person in long-term care living in the Fraser Health Region.\nThe death toll from the disease now stands at 204 people.\nThere are 906 active cases of infection in B.C., up from 896 a day earlier. Twenty-two people are in hospital, seven of them in intensive care.\nNew map shows where cases found\nHenry said going forward, the province will maintain a more granular map of COVID-19 case locations. To date, information has generally been limited to how many cases have been found within each of B.C.'s health authorities.\nOn Thursday, Henry presented a map she said would be updated periodically showing more specifically where new cases are arising.\nTap on the map for a closer look\nHenry said there was a reluctance to release this information earlier in the pandemic because the number of cases was so small that it would make people identifiable in some communities.\n\"We want to give as much information as we can,\" Henry said. \"It doesn't tell the whole story. it doesn't talk about the people who didn't have a test and it also doesn't reflect, necessarily, where somebody was exposed to COVID.\n\"And it doesn't reflect those people who have been quarantined all over the province because they've been exposed in one place or another.\"\nHow it spreads\nHenry was asked about those exposure venues and said while she didn't have exact information, she had a \"rough\" breakdown about where transmission is happening.\nAbout one-third of cases being seen now, she said, are related to events like parties, clubs and nightclubs. Another third is related to transmission within families. The final third is related to exposure in workplace clusters or outbreaks in long-term care.\nShe added about 20 per cent of cases overall are related to international travel but that proportion has declined.\n\"It varies over time,\" she said.\nThe important thing, Henry said, is whether experts can trace those cases and link people who have been potentially exposed.\n\"It's those unlinked cases that we are most concerned about,\" Henry said. \"We still are finding people quickly, we are linking people quickly. Less than 20 per cent of our cases are unlinked. We investigate those very carefully.\"\nNo new health care outbreaks\nThursday's update brings the total number of cases detected in the province to 5,372. Of those, 4,253 people have recovered.\nPublic health officials are monitoring and following up with 2,810 people who are or were close contacts of confirmed cases.\nThere were no new outbreaks in health care reported Thursday.\nThere are 11 active outbreaks, nine in long-term care or assisted living, one in acute care and one at a hospital. Overall, a total of 432 residents and 282 staff have tested positive in health-care settings. The outbreak at the Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver has been declared over.\nA new community outbreak has been reported in Elkford, B.C., in the East Kootenay. Henry said it was at a construction site run by Teck Resources and there is no risk to the community.\nSeven cases have been connected to the outbreak, Henry said. Six of the people who tested positive reside in Alberta and the outbreak was detected after they returned home.\nMIS-C reports\nHenry reported for the first time on suspected cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents (MIS-C) which she said has been associated with COVID-19 in some parts of the world.\nMISC, Henry said, is very similar to Kawasaki Disease, a rare childhood condition. Previously, only cases in which the child tested positive for COVID-19, or was a close contact of someone with COVID-19, would be reported. But now suspected cases are being reported.\nB.C. has had eight suspected cases, she said, but none of the children tested positive for COVID-19, had COVID-19 antibodies or had known exposures to COVID-19 cases.\nThe median age of the children was four years old. Five were male, three were female. All were taken to hospital including two who went into intensive care. B.C. Children's Hospital reported all eight cases.\nAll have recovered, she added.\n\"These are serious illnesses,\" Henry said. \"But this is a reflection of the fact that our system works. We have been monitoring this across B.C. and we will continue to monitor it particularly as we move into the coming months, with things like schools opening.\"\nHenry added later that MIS-C can be caused by factors other than COVID-19.\nSchool questions\nHenry spent some time answering questions about the pending start of school.\nShe said while there are likely to be some cases resulting from the resumption of classes, she is confident they can be managed with contact tracing and precautions called for in reopening plans.\nHenry said the prevalence of the virus in B.C. remains low and contact tracing is working. Officials will continue to watch community spread.\n\"It's going to be okay. We're going to work through this,\" she said.",

    "maintext": "Former Conservative leadership candidate Leslyn Lewis says the Liberals should worry more about sorting out their own house and less about the fate of Conservative MP Derek Sloan.\nLewis and Sloan were both unsuccessful in their recent bids to become the next Conservative Party leader. After Ontario MP Erin O'Toole won that contest earlier this week, Liberal MP Pam Damoff called on the new leader to turf Sloan from caucus over a series of controversial statements the MP made.\nIn April, Sloan published a video on his Facebook page in which he questioned whether Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam \u2014 who was born in Hong Kong \u2014 was working for China.\nBefore that, Sloan came under fire for saying that \"the cause of sexual orientation\" was \"scientifically unclear.\" He also has said he wants Canada to pull out of the UN's Paris agreement on climate change and withdraw all funding from the World Health Organization.\n\"Mr. Trudeau should worry about his own caucus,\" Lewis told host Vassy Kapelos on CBC News Network's Power & Politics Thursday evening. \"Derek Sloan was elected and if ... his constituents feel that they no longer want him, it's up to them to vote him out.\"\n\"I believe that an election will decide that. I don't believe that leaders should be telling people in the electorate who is worthy of that particular seat when they've been voted in. And as I said, the Liberals have their own issues to contend with.\"\nLewis, a social conservative lawyer who immigrated to Canada from Jamaica as a child, impressed many during the leadership contest, finishing first in Saskatchewan and second in Alberta. Since losing to O'Toole, Lewis has said that she intends to run for the Conservatives in the next general election.\n\"I knew in my heart that there was work that I started that I wanted to complete, and that the only way to do that was to run again,\" she said. \"But I did have that discussion with Mr. O'Toole also, and he was very encouraging.\"\nLewis said that riding associations in both Alberta and Saskatchewan have reached out to her to ask her to be their candidate but she has yet to decide where she will run.\n\"I've narrowed it down and I think I'll be making a decision next week. But I have to talk to my children and work a few things out related to my family. And I'll make the best decision for my family and for the party and for the country,\" she said.\n'I should earn it': Lewis\nLewis said that she has not been promised a high-profile position in the party should she win her seat, and she's not the type of person to ask for one.\n\"I believe that everything that I gain, I should earn it,\" she said. \"I even said to [O'Toole] that I'm open to running a contested nomination and I didn't want to be granted a seat. I wanted to work for whichever riding I picked \u2026 and I would welcome anybody who wishes that they want to challenge me in that riding.\"\nIn his first press conference after becoming leader of the Conservatives, O'Toole emphasized his pro-choice position on abortion. Lewis was asked if she has any concerns about her views being represented by the O'Toole leadership.\n\"People are individuals and they're entitled to their opinions and Mr. O'Toole is a professional,\" Lewis said. \"I see his opinion is no different than how I would see myself having an opinion and making sure that I implement the best policies for the country. I have no doubt that Mr. O'Toole is going to do that.\"\nAsked what she would like to see her party do about systemic racism in Canada, Lewis said that proper policing training could go a long way and she would like to see her party push that idea forward.\n\"I believe that my party believes that all professionals should have proper training,\" she said. \"If there is a point in time or incidents occur where we believe that the training needs to be improved in whatever aspect, whether it's use of force, we could always invest in that and make sure that police officers have proper resources and proper training to deal with various [incidents] ... including the heightened tensions around COVID and racialized situations.\"\nFor more stories about the experiences of Black Canadians \u2014 from anti-Black racism to success stories within the Black community \u2014 check out Being Black in Canada, a CBC project Black Canadians can be proud of.

    "maintext": "Send this page to someone via email\nWith an unprecedented school year just around the corner, many are expecting a higher number of absent teachers in Alberta\u2019s classrooms as a result of COVID-19 guidelines.\nSubstitute teachers will be filling many holes at schools across the province, and with that comes elevated concern about whether educators moving between schools might pose a higher risk of transmission.\nThe government of Alberta said it won\u2019t be limiting where substitute teachers can work and how many schools or classrooms they can teach in. When they are going into schools, substitutes are expected to follow the same public health measures that are in place for all other staff and students, including wearing a mask.\n\u201cWhere possible, it is good for substitute teachers to limit the number of schools they teach at,\u201d government spokesperson Ted Bauer said in an emailed statement to Global News.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\u201cSubstitute teachers have the choice which schools to work at and are not required to work at multiple schools.\u201d\n2:06 School bus drivers raise concerns over COVID-19 School bus drivers raise concerns over COVID-19\nUniversity of Calgary associate professor of microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases Dr. Craig Jenne said ideally, substitute teachers would cohort and do their best to limit travelling between schools. However, he said teachers working in multiple schools \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily elevate the risk.\u201d\n\u201cMost schools, this won\u2019t be a big problem unless we actually have active cases in the school,\u201d Jenne said. \u201cBut the hard part is we sometimes don\u2019t know there\u2019s an active case until a couple [of] days after the infectious period.\u201d\nJenne said substitute teachers moving between schools won\u2019t necessarily make contact tracing more difficult, as schools will be keeping logs, but it would make the process more time consuming for those tasked with finding and contacting people they\u2019ve been in contact with.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\u201cIf there were enough staff, I\u2019d love to see more limits on moving between the schools not only in a given day, even perhaps within a given week,\u201d Jenne said, adding that would give time for symptoms to develop if someone had been exposed or for them to get a call from contract tracers.\nAlberta Teachers\u2019 Association president Jason Schilling said the association has been asking whether there would be limits on the movement of substitutes, but none have been implemented. He said the association wants to see a minimum safety standard for substitute teachers.\n\u201cWhen they go into a school, there should be things set aside specifically for the sub to use that day,\u201d Schilling said. Tweet This\n\u201cSo a laptop that hasn\u2019t been used by anyone [that is] disinfected and ready to go, masks, other PPE if they should need it, hand sanitizer \u2014 to essentially have a substitute box so subs are safe when they go into the building.\u201d\nThe government has made individual boards responsible for making guidelines for substitute teachers, saying they \u201chave the autonomy and accountability to make decisions about the programming and operations of their schools.\u201d\nStory continues below advertisement\nHere\u2019s a look at the considerations Alberta\u2019s four biggest school districts have in place to help mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spread this school year:\n[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]\nCalgary Board of Education\nSubstitute teachers will be allowed to move between schools within the Calgary Board of Education this fall, but the board is recommending they try to only teach in one school per day \u2014 and one classroom within that school \u2014 to help limit any potential spread of COVID-19.\n\u201cIt is ultimately up to the substitute teacher how many assignments/locations they accept in a day,\u201d CBE spokesperson Megan Geyer said in an email.\nThe board said it wasn\u2019t worried about whether contact tracing would be more difficult with substitute teachers coming into multiple schools, as it will be keeping records of anyone entering classrooms each day.\nThe CBE is also not requiring that substitute teachers cohort but said teachers can self-cohort if they want and accept assignments based on their cohorts.\n\u201cSubstitute teachers may, therefore, choose to limit the number of schools or areas they accept job assignments for in the 2020-21 school year, without penalty or prejudice,\u201d Geyer said.\nStory continues below advertisement\n2:29 CBE schools prepare to reopen with new safety measures CBE schools prepare to reopen with new safety measures\nThe CBE said it has increased its substitute teacher roster by more than 30 per cent for the fall semester and expects to have close to 1,800 educators available.\nCalgary Catholic School Board\nThe Calgary Catholic School Board said it won\u2019t be limiting the schools substitute teachers can work in, adding they \u201cwill be allowed to pick up assignments based on their skills and qualifications and what schools they have made themselves available for.\u201d\nHowever, spokesperson Sandra Borowski said the board is encouraging teachers to limit the number of schools they pick up shifts at.\nWhether teachers can work in multiple classrooms in a school on any given day will be up to the principal of each school and what precautions they\u2019ve put in place, the board said.\nStory continues below advertisement\nElectronic systems will track where subs have worked, so the CCSD doesn\u2019t expect to face any additional challenges with contact tracing.\nThe CCSD said because it can\u2019t speculate what the absentee rate for permanent teaching staff will be, it couldn\u2019t estimate how many substitute teachers it expects to have working in its schools in the fall.\n2:51 Calgary catholic school board shows off COVID-19 precautions Calgary catholic school board shows off COVID-19 precautions\nEdmonton Catholic School District\nThe Edmonton Catholic School District said it has assigned substitute teachers to specific sites.\n\u201cIf there are more absences at a school beyond what the assigned subs can handle, we will have substitutes available to be called to different sites,\u201d spokesperson Lori Nagy said.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\u201cIf we notice through monitoring absence data that a specific school is needing additional subs beyond the number assigned, we have the ability to add a permanent sub.\u201d\nTeachers can apply for the cohort substitute positions, and the number of substitutes assigned to each school will depend on things like medical appointments and sick leave, the board said.\n3:52 A look inside Edmonton schools preparing for the return of in-person classes A look inside Edmonton schools preparing for the return of in-person classes\nNagy said the teachers will likely be moving between classrooms in schools on any given day, week or month.\nThe ECSD has about 650 substitute teachers on its roster heading into the fall semester.\nEdmonton Public School Board\nThe Edmonton Public School Board said it\u2019s following the province\u2019s guidelines for substitute teachers and won\u2019t be restricting where they can work within the district.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\u201cWe are encouraging schools to create designated substitute lists, to help limit the number of supply teachers entering a school,\u201d chief human resources officer Angela Anderson said in an emailed statement.\nAny substitute teachers going into schools will be required to follow the same protocols in place for permanent teachers, staff and students, Anderson said. The substitutes will be tracked through the board\u2019s supply management system.\nThe EPSB currently has 1,718 substitute teachers on its roster and is working to confirm how many will be available in the fall.\n2:12 Coronavirus: Tips to send your children back to school in optimal health Coronavirus: Tips to send your children back to school in optimal health\nThe government announced in July that students will be heading back to the classroom in the fall under school re-entry Scenario 1: near-normal daily operations and added health measures.\nStory continues below advertisement",

    "maintext": "TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer has left the Chinese-owned video app firm just three months since joining, and only days since the company sued the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump over an executive order effectively banning it in the United States.\nHe will be replaced by U.S. General Manager Vanessa Pappas on an interim basis, TikTok said in a statement.\nThe resignation comes at a tricky time for super-fast growing TikTok as it tries to persuade both the United States and India that it is not a security threat, while at the same time holding discussions with prospective buyers following a second U.S. order demanding the sale of its U.S. operations.\nMayer was Walt Disney Co.'s top streaming executive before becoming chief executive officer of TikTok and chief operating officer of parent ByteDance on June 1.\n\"In recent weeks, as the political environment has sharply changed, I have done significant reflection on what the corporate structural changes will require, and what it means for the global role I signed up for,\" Mayer said in an letter to employees.\n\"Against this backdrop, and as we expect to reach a resolution very soon, it is with a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to leave the company.\"\nWalmart, Microsoft make bid\nWalmart is the latest company to want a piece of TikTok, as the world's largest retailer made a joint bid with Microsoft to buy TikTok's U.S. business, according to a person close to the deal who isn't authorized to discuss the terms publicly.\nMicrosoft and Walmart have been business partners since 2018, when the companies signed a five-year partnership in which Microsoft provides cloud computing services that help run the retailer's stores and online shopping.\nWalmart said in a statement Thursday that a deal with Microsoft and TikTok could help it expand its advertising business and reach more shoppers.\nMicrosoft has confirmed discussions with TikTok; other tech companies such as Oracle are also reportedly interested in a possible acquisition.\nWhile ByteDance hasn't disclosed its asking price for TikTok, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that it is seeking roughly $30 billion US for TikTok's U.S. operations.\n'Complex times': ByteDance CEO\nByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yiming said in a separate letter reviewed by Reuters that the company was \"moving quickly to find resolutions to the issues that we face globally, particularly in the U.S. and India.\"\nHe said Mayer had joined just as the company was \"entering arguably our most challenging moment.\"\n\"It is never easy to come into a leadership position in a company moving as quickly as we are, and the circumstances following his arrival made it all the more complex,\" Zhang said.\nHow TikTok, its current owner ByteDance, Donald Trump, China and Microsoft are coming together in a political dance that is far more complicated than learning the \"renegade.\" We explain just what is happening (so far) as the globally-popular social network could find politics and business combining to fracture its audience. 5:07\nByteDance employees told Reuters they were not surprised by Mayer's decision given TikTok's unpredictable future, and also because the ex-Disney executive has not had a significant role in some important decisions as he was still new to the team.\nZhang has been the key person in TikTok sale talks, said two people with knowledge of the matter. But Mayer represented TikTok to discuss with senior executives of interested buyers just days ago, a third person said.\nTikTok's decision to launch a $200 million US \"creator fund\" in July was spearheaded by TikTok's former head Alex Zhu, though Mayer was also directly involved, said two of the people. The project was initiated internally much earlier than Mayer's arrival, one of the people said.\n\"The learning curve was steep for him, from daily operations to geopolitical implications,\" said one of the people.\nByteDance did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.\n\"Whether TikTok reaches an agreement to sell its U.S. business or decides to duke it out in the courts, the role for Mayer will not be anything like that he had envisioned when he joined,\" said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting in Beijing.\nRepublican senator reacts:\n.@tiktok_us CEO is jumping ship, blames Trump administration. He should blame himself for signing up to be public face of a #Beijing Trojan horse https://t.co/y0FBaYJpuK \u2014@HawleyMO\nMayer's departure is not a great boost for company morale right now, Natkin said.\nHis successor Pappas joined TikTok in January 2019 as U.S. general manager. She was previously global head of Creative Insights at Google's YouTube, her LinkedIn profile showed.\nChallenged in India as well\nAmid growing distrust between Washington and Beijing, Trump complained that TikTok was a national security threat and could share information about users with China's government.\nTrump issued an executive order banning U.S. transactions with TikTok on Aug. 6, effective in mid-September. He issued a separate order about a week later giving ByteDance 90 days to divest of TikTok's U.S. operations and data.\nThe company has been targeted in India, where TikTok was one of 59 Chinese apps banned by the Indian government in June following a border clash between India and China.\nThat month, Mayer wrote to India's government saying China's government has never requested user data, nor would TikTok turn it over if asked.\nTechCrunch reported earlier this month that ByteDance was in talks with India's Reliance for investment in TikTok.\nTikTok has become a global sensation since ByteDance launched the app in 2017, with operations in countries such as France, South Korea, Indonesia, Russia and Brazil. In April, the app hit 2 billion downloads globally.",

Higher provisions eroded profit in the fiscal third quarter, with results beating analysts\u2019 estimates.\nKey Insights\nToronto-Dominion set aside a record C$3.22 billion in the second quarter to brace for a wave of impaired loans from the pandemic. That appeared to be a peak, with provisions in the fiscal third quarter totaling C$2.19 billion, more than triple the amount a year earlier.Canada\u2019s second-largest lender by assets has been facing shrinking net interest margins -- the difference between what a bank charges for loans and pays for deposits -- as central banks cut rates to shore up economies amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Overall net interest margins were 1.73% in the fiscal third quarter, compared with 1.91% in the prior three months and 1.93% a year earlier -- shrinking to the lowest in at least 18 years.Toronto-Dominion had a record contribution from its investment in the U.S. online brokerage TD Ameritrade, thanks to a retail trading boom during the pandemic. That showed up in the lender\u2019s U.S. retail business, which nevertheless saw a 48% earnings decline to C$673 million as loan-loss provisions surged from a year earlier.Canadian personal and commercial banking is Toronto-Dominion\u2019s largest business, accounting for almost half the bank\u2019s overall earnings. The domestic division had earnings of C$721 million in the quarter, down 49% from a year earlier amid higher loan-loss provisions.A flurry of trading activity and dealmaking has helped the investment-banking businesses of Canada\u2019s banks through the third quarter. Toronto-Dominion followed the trend, with its TD Securities capital-markets division posting quarterly earnings of C$442 million, compared with C$244 million a year earlier.\nMarket Reaction\nShares of Toronto-Dominion have fallen 8.9% this year through Wednesday, compared with a 9.6% decline for the eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index.\nGet More\nThird-quarter net income fell 31% to C$2.25 billion, or C$1.21 a share. Adjusted per-share earnings totaled C$1.25, beating the C$1.23 average estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.Read more about Toronto-Dominion\u2019s quarterly results here.\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",

A COVID-19 vaccine-development partnership between China's CanSino Biologics and Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia has been abandoned.\nA COVID-19 vaccine-development partnership between Canada and a Chinese firm has been abandoned, ending clinical trials that were to be conducted by a Dalhousie University research lab.\nThe National Research Council of Canada said Thursday the CanSino Biologics vaccine intended for phase one clinical trials has not been approved by Chinese customs for shipment to Canada.\n\"Due to the delay in the shipment of the vaccine doses to Canada it is evident this specific opportunity is over and the NRC is focusing its team and facilities on other partners and COVID-19 priorities,\" the agency said in a statement.\nCanada's Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne downplayed suggestions the vaccine partnership failed because of ongoing political tensions between the two countries.\n\"I don't necessarily think so,\" Champagne told reporters Thursday. \"I can only speak for the Canadian side. I would not necessarily link whether that particular opportunity is linked to anything else.\"\nRelations have been sour since the Chinese detained Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in apparent retaliation for the RCMP's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on an American extradition warrant in December 2018.\nDespite the tensions, Champagne said \"we have issues in terms of global health where we can work together.\"\nThe Canadian Centre for Vaccinology at Dalhousie University was supposed to conduct the trials through a partnership with the NRC and CanSino Biologics. Dalhousie's lab had been ready to start clinical trials as early as June, the NRC said, after Health Canada approved CanSino's proposal.\nThe Halifax lab was one of several in Canada and in the U.S. whose work in 2014 led to an Ebola vaccine that was used in West Africa.\nDr. Scott Halperin, the director of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology, said it was disappointing the CanSino project won't be going ahead.\n\"The CanSino vaccine is one of the most furthest along of any of the candidate vaccines so it would have been nice to do that study,\" Halperin said. \"It's not the only vaccine that we are working with ... but we certainly don't like to lose access to any one of them because we need multiple vaccines.\"\nHalperin said all of the protocols had been written and approved and had his lab received the vaccine its study would have been \"well along by now.\"\n\"We thought the shipment would be coming any day, as did the company,\" he said. \"There was no bad faith on the company \u2014 they were trying everything but they could not get (Chinese) government approval to ship it. The request for shipment hasn't been denied it just hasn't been approved.\"\nHalperin said the Halifax lab would be working on other COVID-19 studies and is in discussions with at least six different manufacturers. Once approvals are granted he said at least two of the studies could begin as early as next month.\n\"Things are moving along. We weren't sitting and waiting for CanSino and doing nothing else.\"",

    "maintext": "WestJet is taking tough new measures beginning next week against passengers who refuse to comply with federal masking rules on flights.\nThe airline says it will go as far as booting passengers off flights who consistently refuse to wear a mask or face covering while on board.\n\"If the plane has not left the ... [ground] and somebody refused to wear a mask, we will return to the gate,\" WestJet president and CEO Ed Sims said in an exclusive interview with CBC News.\nSims said in \"extreme circumstances\" \u2014 if passengers continue to ignore masking rules \u2014 the plane will turn around and return to its point of origin.\nTransport Canada requires everyone over the age of two wear a mask on board all flights. A recent order added that only those with an official doctor's note are exempt from mandatory masking.\nWestJet says it hopes to avoid the extreme measures of ejecting non-compliant passengers seen with increasingly regularity on U.S. carriers.\n\"I have an obligation and a duty of care to our staff,\" Sims said. \"I also have an obligation to every other guest. So my focus is on the 99 per cent of guests who continue to wear masks.\"\nEd Sims, president and CEO of WestJet, speaks during an interview in Vancouver. (CBC News)\nOn Friday morning, the airline will announce that effective Sept. 1, 2020, it will implement an escalating response to those resisting mask use:\nGuests will first be asked to put the mask on by cabin crew.\nAn official warning will be issued that mask compliance is necessary.\nIf those two measures don't get passengers to don a mask, there will be long-term sanctions. Sims said those guests will be put on a year long no-fly list.\n\"We will let those guests who are in wilful non-compliance know that they will be suspended from flying.\"\nAir Canada says, as a rule, it doesn't publicly discuss safety and enforcement measures, but it did confirm it has \"a graded approach, up to and including travel bans, to promote compliance with facial covering requirements.\"\nAir Canada will only say it has had a small number of incidents with passengers refusing to wear masks.\nWestJet passengers in masks queue to check-in at Calgary International Airport. (Colin Hall/CBC News)\n'This is not just a one and done'\nWestJet says it has had 30 issues with passengers refusing to wear a face covering. CEO Ed Sims says that number may increase, \"We are taking this opportunity to say this is not just a one and done. If you decide to be in non-compliance, you're going to be paying that price for at least the next 12 months.\"\nUniversity of Calgary infectious disease specialist Craig Jenne says tough mask rules on planes are needed because physical distancing isn't possible, \"We need to bring in those other layers of protection, such as wearing a mask to avoid droplets spreading to the people not only near you, but perhaps circulating the air and even getting to distal rows on the plane.\"\nCraig Jenne is a professor at the University of Calgary. (Colin Hall/CBC News )\nAlso beginning Sept. 1, WestJet will require all passengers to provide contact information at check-in, regardless of whether that happens online or in the airport. Passengers will no longer be able to by-pass that step.\nThe goal is to be able to provide health authorities with the information for rapid contact tracing should a passenger on a flight test positive for the coronavirus.\nWestJet says it is working with the Vancouver airport and researchers to develop a pilot program where passengers on certain flights will be tested for the coronavirus to determine if pre-flight testing can help reduce the spread.",

    "maintext": "(Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Thursday told Reuters that Apple Inc rejected its attempt to tell users the iPhone maker would take a 30% cut of sales in a new online events feature, forcing Facebook to remove the message to get the tool to users.\nFILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic\nFacebook said that Apple cited an App Store rule that bars developers from showing \u201cirrelevant\u201d information to users.\n\u201cNow more than ever, we should have the option to help people understand where money they intend for small businesses actually goes. Unfortunately Apple rejected our transparency notice around their 30% tax but we are still working to make that information available inside the app experience,\u201d Facebook said in a statement.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\nFacebook earlier this month said it planned to roll out a new tool that would let online influencers and other businesses host paid online events as a way to offset revenue lost during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe company said it had asked Apple to waive the 30% fee the iPhone maker charges for in-app purchases so Facebook could pass on all of the events revenue to business owners, but that Apple declined.\nFacebook had aimed to provide a notice of Apple\u2019s cut to users, according to mock-ups it released at the time, but Reuters found on Thursday that the promised message was not present on the new events feature.\nThe social media giant also planned to tell users on Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Play store it would not collect a fee for ticket sales, but that message was not displayed either, Reuters found.\nIn publicly criticizing Apple\u2019s App Store commissions, Facebook joined other developers such as \u201cFortnite\u201d creator Epic Games, which is suing Apple on antitrust allegations over the fees. Facebook is also wrangling with Apple over new privacy rules for iPhones that will require more notifications before tracking users across apps.\nBoth companies, along with fellow tech giants Alphabet and Amazon, are facing multiple probes over alleged anticompetitive behavior.",

    "maintext": "Amazon has entered the health and fitness world with Halo, a subscription service and accompanying fitness band that unlocks an array of health metrics, including activity, sleep, body fat and tone of voice analysis, to determine how you sound to others. Amazon's entry into the fitness space is odd indeed, and ambitious. And we're just getting our minds wrapped around it.\nThe band itself looks a lot like a screenless Fitbit tracker, but with a few different elements: It has temperature sensing, much like Fitbit's newest smartwatch, the Fitbit Sense, and a microphone that continually scans a wearer's voice to determine emotional tone. Yes, it's a lot to take in. And the service is immediately available for early access. We haven't even had a chance to try it out yet.\nThe membership part will start at $65 for the first six months ($100 once the early access deal is over) and then $3.99 a month after that. (International prices aren't currently available, but $65 converts to about \u00a350 or AU$90.) The subscription to Halo includes the basic fitness band that has one button, no screen and tracks your heart rate, steps and temperature. The lack of screen means you'll have to rely on the mobile app to see all your data, but it does a lot more than just count your steps and log your weight.\nA tone-analyzing, Amazon health band that also lets you scan your body fat may sound like Black Mirror incarnate, but it's also opening up some ideas in fitness that we've never seen before.\nNow playing: Watch this: Amazon's Halo takes fitness tracking to new and uncomfortable...\nBody fat analysis with a smartphone camera\nAmazon thinks the concept of weight loss is flawed, and that body fat is a much better predictor of health.\nMost of us have been conditioned to obsess over our weight. The entire diet industry was built on it with programs, apps and devices that revolve around ways to lose pounds.\nBut weight can fluctuate daily based on factors including humidity, medication, menstrual cycle and illness. Plus muscle is more dense than fat, and a scale can't tell the difference between the two. You could literally work your ass off building muscle and burning fat, and not see the numbers on the scale go down.\nRather than relying on weight, Halo focuses on body fat percentage, which is less volatile and takes a lot more time and work to change.\nThe gold standard in the medical world for body composition analysis is a DEXA scan (dual-energy absorptiometry), which can cost up to $100 at a lab. The Halo app does it all using your smartphone camera. Once you take your photos, the app automatically eliminates everything else in the background, calculates body fat percent based on body indicators, and then creates a 3D model of your body, which is both cool and terrifying. The app requires you to wear minimal form-fitting clothing and trust Amazon to take a picture of you wearing it. The entire process takes seconds.\nAmazon\nIf you're feeling uncomfortable, that's not surprising: The idea of body-scanning with a camera is already an awkward proposition. Amazon doing this on a health platform makes it feel more so. The sample body-scan images Amazon showed me look very personal -- not necessarily something I'd ever want anyone else to see.\nThat's why Amazon promises that the finished body scans stay on your phone and won't be shared with anybody, including the company, unless you opt into that. According to Amazon, \"the images are processed in the cloud, but encrypted in transit and processed within seconds, after which they're automatically deleted from Amazon's systems and databases. All scan images are fully deleted within 12 hours. The scan images aren't viewed by anyone at Amazon and aren't used for machine learning optimizations.\"\nWatch that tone!\nHalo also offers a Tone analysis, which has nothing to do with body tone, but rather analyzes the nuances of your voice to paint a picture of how you sound to others. It can let you know when you've sounded out of line, weirdly enough.\nThe fitness band has two built-in mics to capture audio and it listens for emotional cues. The company says it's not intended to analyze the content of your conversation, just the tone of your delivery. It takes periodic samples of your speech throughout the day if you opt in to the feature. You enable the microphones by tapping the side button and you'll know when the mic is off when a red LED lights up on the band.\nAmazon\nThe voice scanning pulls out the wearer's specific voice in conversations and delivers analysis with related emotional-tone words (like \"happy,\" or \"concerned\" in the Halo app). The idea, according to Amazon, is to help guide you to deliver better tones of voice and speaking styles, like a vocal form of good posture. It isn't intended as a form of psychological analysis, but it seems awfully hard to draw the line on a concept like this.\nAmazon's been exploring the idea of emotional tone-sensing since at least 2018, but this is the first time it's approached the idea in any device. And according to Amazon, the Tone feature is only available on the Halo band for now. It will be limited to the band's microphone, but Amazon sounds open to exploring the idea on other devices, depending on how the early access response goes from first-wave wearers. It's a very odd thing to put on a fitness band, and we have no idea what this is like to use yet.\nAmazon promises that Tone voice samples are encrypted and stored only on a wearer's phone (shared from the band via Bluetooth with the encrypted key), are deleted after analysis and won't be shared to the cloud or used to build machine-learning models.\nSleep analysis with temperature tracking\nAmazon\nThe app provides a comprehensive sleep analysis with a breakdown of the different stages of sleep and overall sleep score, much like other fitness trackers. It also goes beyond the basics by keeping track of your overall body temperature during sleep and creating a baseline for each person. It then charts your average temperature each night relative to your baseline to help you identify variations that could affect your health and the quality of your sleep.\nThe Halo band won't provide a specific body temperature, similar to the way other temperature wearable devices like the Oura Ring already work.\nTemperature has become a trending wearable metric in the COVID-19 era: The Oura Ring has one and Fitbit's newest Sense watch has one too. Amazon's Halo team is pursuing research for COVID-19 symptom detection on its wearables, much like other health wearable companies, but no specific studies or plans have been laid out yet.\nActivity tracking: A week at a glance\nAmazon\nHalo also does basic fitness tracking based on the information from the band. It can automatically track walks and runs, but you'll have to go into the app and tag any other workouts manually.\nIt rewards you for any type of movement or activity, but gives more points for more intense workouts and subtracts points for sedentary time. And it doesn't keep a daily tally of your activity, your score is based on the points you accrued during the entire week. The entire picture of exercise, sedentary time and active time is combined into one tally.\nAmazon's sleep and activity scores and other AI tools will require an Amazon Halo subscription; otherwise, the band will default to more basic tracking data. Much like Fitbit and its Premium service, this looks to be continuing a trend of fitness devices that expect a subscription model as part of the package.\nA lot of labs and partners, but no Google or Apple integration\nA Labs section of Amazon Halo looks similar to what's on Fitbit's Premium service, with a lot of multiweek health and fitness goals to opt into, and partners lined up from OrangeTheory to Weight Watchers. Amazon promises these challenges are scientifically vetted, but it also sounds like these challenges will keep being added to over time.\nBut at least at launch, Halo will not tie in to Apple's HealthKit or Google's Fit App which puts it at a disadvantage with people who are already deeply invested in either for health tracking. Amazon is leaning on Weight Watchers, John Hancock Vitality wellness program, and a few others that will be able to hook into Amazon Halo health data.\nThe looming privacy question\nThere's a lot of process in terms of features, and while some seem interesting and innovative, the biggest barrier to entry is privacy. Sharing any kind of health data (let alone unflattering seminudes) requires next-level trust, and you might not be prepared to give Amazon that trust. The company doesn't exactly have the most pristine track record when it comes to keeping user data private. Alexa-enabled devices have been in the hot seat for storing private conversations \"for machine learning purposes.\" And Amazon's Ring doorbell has had a series of privacy dust-ups.\nHalo puts privacy in your hands by allowing you to opt out of data sharing with Amazon and third-party apps as well as disable the microphone on the band, but it's still going to be an uphill battle. That is unless its features prove to be earth-shattering and worth the privacy risk, which remains to be seen.\nAmazon is late on arrival\nThe lack of connection to Apple or Google is telling. Amazon's making a play in the health and fitness data space, and with Google, Fitbit and Apple already deep in, it's a big question as to how Amazon will make waves. Or, where Amazon Halo will go next. It's a platform as much as a wearable, and it sounds like Halo's early-access experiment may just be the tip of the iceberg.",

Before making the decision to see it\u2014or any other film\u2014in a movie theater, please consider the health risks involved. Click here for an interview on the matter with scientific experts.\nAdvertisement\nIf you squint a little, the original Bill & Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure counts as edutainment. After all, the 1989 comedy revolved around two teenage slackers who used a time machine to kidnap historical figures, all in hopes of passing an upcoming exam. And though it played mostly fast and loose with the textbook stuff, the plot has, in the years since, made the movie an unlikely favorite of high-school history teachers. That lesson-plan-friendly element was tossed like a roach from the window of a beat-up Subaru for the sequel, Bill & Ted\u2019s Bogus Journey, but it returns in a hybridized, even more dubiously educational form in the 29-years-later threequel Bill & Ted Face The Music. Here, historical figures\u2014both real and made up\u2014party alongside robots with low self-esteem, alternate future selves, cameoing celebrities, and, of course, Death.\nAdvertisement\nMovie Review Movie Review Bill & Ted Face The Music C+ C+ Bill & Ted Face The Music Director Dean Parisot Runtime 88 minutes Rating PG-13 Language English Cast Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, Brigette Lundy-Paine, Samara Weaving, Kristen Schaal Availability VOD and select theaters August 28\nTrue to the surfer-dude spirit of its boneheaded leads, Bill & Ted Face The Music has a laidback quality that makes it less overstimulating than it could have been, given its multiple storylines and chaotic cast of characters. As the plot kicks into gear, Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are tasked by Kelly (Kristen Schaal), daughter of George Carlin\u2019s time-traveling tour guide, to write a song that will save the world from temporal collapse. Problem is, they only have 75 minutes to do it. To make the deadline, the now middle-aged pals set out on a journey to find versions of themselves that have already written the song so they can plagiarize their own work. Meanwhile, their daughters, Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine) and Thea (Samara Weaving), embark on a parallel quest to assemble the best backing band ever, which ends up including both the iconic (DazMann Still as Jimi Hendrix) and the available (Kid Cudi as himself).\nAdvertisement\nBill & Ted Face The Music doesn\u2019t find its rhythm until these two storylines converge an hour in, which means that this 88-minute movie is basically over before it really begins. Up to that point, director Dean Parisot (of Galaxy Quest fame) and writers Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson (who also scripted Excellent Adventure and Bogus Journey) bounce from scenario to scenario like they\u2019re flipping through the channels of an all-Bill & Ted cable package. It\u2019s an approach that allows for some fun moments, like Reeves and Winter in spandex and wigs squatting at Dave Grohl\u2019s house, as well as the performance of a Wyld Stallyns composition called \u201cThat Which Binds Us Through Time\u2014The Chemical, Physical, And Biological Nature Of Love And The Exploration Of The Meaning Of Meaning, Pt. 1.\u201d But there are missed opportunities, too. Why cast Barry\u2019s Anthony Carrigan as the aforementioned insecure murder droid and then do nothing fun with him until the movie is almost over?\nPhoto : MGM\nAdvertisement\nTo fill all that time up front, Face The Music largely focuses on the middle-aged ennui that sends Bill, Ted, and their wives, Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes) and Joanna (Jayma Mays), into marriage counseling. Bill and Ted were never deep characters, but the film\u2019s superficial treatment of their personal crises makes it feel like they\u2019ve been kept in cryogenic storage for 29 years waiting to be defrosted, rather than rocking out and raising their kids and, you know, evolving at all over the years that have passed. Anyway, it\u2019s not like the film needed another thread to tie up.\nThe characters haven\u2019t changed much, but CGI technology definitely has. Bill & Ted Face The Music takes advantage of those improvements with a plethora of scenes set in the future and in Hell, both upgraded from relatively modest sets to epic green-screen environments. These are a welcome alternative to the utterly generic, cheap-looking suburban locations the characters otherwise occupy. But aside from the scene-stealing return of William Sadler, reprising his role as Death himself from Bogus Journey, the addition of characters from these fantasy realms doesn\u2019t bring all that much to the story.\nAdvertisement\nThe Bill & Ted movies derive much of their humor from the blending of extremely low and extremely high stakes. Face The Music kind of blows it on the former : For all the preaching about the importance of togetherness and unity, the film mostly keeps its fiftysomething stars and their kids apart. Which is a shame, as the younger Logan and Preston are a hoot\u2014particularly Lundy-Paine, who replicates Reeves\u2019 dopey facial expressions and burnout inflection with precision. And while the high stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, the film simply takes too long to find its focus. It\u2019s not the most excellent of outcomes, but not a total bummer, either.",

    "maintext": "But he woke up Thursday morning surrounded. Surrounded in support and friendship. Reaves found out how much he mattered to his teammates and his league. He found out those around him understood, though they could never walk his path, that it was a painful path. And they wanted to help create change in his world. Here in hockey, we often use the phrase \"the hockey world.\" It's a bubble of its own. On Thursday, NHL players chose to step out of that bubble. To leave the hockey world and step into the real world. A world where racism is too strong and social justice is too weak. They looked beyond their scope and chose to make a statement.\nNHL players have elected to take Thursday and Friday off from playing games. They told their story over Zoom calls with a handful of players including Reaves at microphones, but a mass of players standing behind them from all four teams left in the Stanley Cup playoffs Western Conference bubble.\nThe Vegas Golden Knights winger was floored by the help offered from across the league.\n\"I have to go back to (Wednesday) night to be honest. We went out for dinner with a couple of the boys and then Brayden McNabb asked if we were going to play (Thursday). I said 'yeah, why not?' I then came upstairs and asked myself if we were really going to play. Are we not going to support what's going on here? We have to, you have to think we are. Honestly I was up all night,\" said Reaves.\n\"I ended up calling Marc-Andre Fleury, I texted him at 12 a.m. to see if he was still up. He called me back and we had a decent conversation. In my head, I was thinking about how there were only a couple players of color in the bubble. How is this going to look? Am I just going to walk out to support my black community? Am I going to be the one or two or three out of the eight teams doing it? Am I not going to support and just go play and act like everything is fine? I was back and forth, but in my head I felt like we shouldn't play. I felt like this was something that we needed to support.\n\"Lo and behold, I wake up after an hour or two of sleep and I have a text from Kevin Shattenkirk asking me to call him. I called him and he said he had players from the teams out east and they wanted to hear what I had to say. I said I feel like it's a strong message and a very powerful message if a sport like hockey, which is predominantly white, can stand up and say I don't know what you've been through and never will, but I see what's going on in this country and I don't think it is right. Every single player said they would stand behind it and that we should not play. I got another text that Vancouver wanted to talk. I get outside their locker room and every one of those guys thought we should sit for two days and said they'd stand behind it. It was a big exhale for me because I felt like I was alone in it, but it was the exact opposite. I couldn't have felt more in a group than I did this morning. It was great because it was such a powerful message to see that people really see what is going on in this country. As white athletes, they don't want to stand for it anymore. To take that stance, I applaud every single NHL player right now. I really do.\"\nReaves is 33 and born in Canada. His father Willard was born in Flagstaff, Arizona, and played pro football in the NHL and CFL before settling in Winnipeg and working as a sheriff. The family has a long background law enforcement and Reaves says he supports the military.\n\"A couple of us took a knee in that first game with Dallas. It was talked about, good or bad, it was talked about. It was in the media and we had to talk about it. It started the conversation. Like I stated before, I have so much respect for the people that protect this country the right way, the people that go overseas to protect this country and the rights of this country while putting their lives on the line,\" he said.\n\"We got the conversation started and now stand for the people that fight for those freedoms. I think you can do it both ways, as long as the message is right. There are going to be the people that disagree. I got a lot of hate in my inbox, I know Robin Lehner did too. There was a lot of hate in what we did. You can't satisfy everybody, but what I believe in was more powerful. I felt that I had to do what I believed in, and then I stood for what I believed in. As long as the message is right, you can do both.\"\nReaves believes in peaceful protest and plans to be proactive and to attempt to inspire positive change.\n\"I'm stuck in a bubble right now and all I can do right now is what we just organized together. The conversation has been started. This is going to be on TV, this is going to be talked about for a couple days. That alone right there is a very powerful start,\" said Reaves.\n\"When we get out of the bubble, we've got to get out in these communities. We're hockey players. We should start with hockey. We should start by bringing more black players, more players of color into the sport, building rinks in those communities, getting them equipment, because equipment is not cheap. Hockey is a hard sport to get into because it's not cheap to play. A stick costs $200. People can't afford that. Not everybody can afford that kind of stuff. It is a very privileged sport to play. If you can get out into these communities and start bringing the sport to them. Start bringing them equipment, build rinks there, run some hockey camps with a couple of the players free of charge to get out in those communities, meet with these kids and get them to start enjoying the game. That's a great start right there. For me, when I get out of the bubble that's where I'm starting for sure.\"\nVegas coach Pete DeBoer spoke Thursday and singled out Reaves:\n\"Real proud of Ryan. It hasn't just been the last 24 hours, we've had ongoing conversations going back to the beginning when we got into the bubble and when Ryan and a group of other players took a knee during the national anthem. He is a smart, intellectual guy that has a lot of loyalty to both his race, but also to law enforcement and military. He doesn't do anything without considering everything. When we discussed what was going to go on here today, he had my full support. I don't think he slept a lot last night and I think it weighed heavily on him. I also think he was very comfortable in his decision. I'm real proud of him and proud to stand behind him.\"\nReaves is the only black player in the Golden Knights lineup right now. But his teammates didn't just stand behind him on Thursday. They held long conversations and while not all originally agreed with the decision not to play, they eventually settled on the course of action as a team, said Reaves.\n\"Look, they could have said 'We want to play. We're playing well right now and we don't think this is the right thing to do.' And to be honest not every single player wanted to necessarily sit out for two days,\" said Reaves. \"I didn't know if I wanted to sit out for two days. I was back and forth with it just like some of the guys on the team were. But the most powerful thing was they said 'If that's what you think needs to be done, I stand behind you.' That's the kind of team we have. We support each other in decisions we make, whether you believe it or not or whether you think it's the right way of going about it. Every single guy once we talked about it said 'Hey, I support what you're doing. We're not going to play these next two days.' I thank every player on this team too.\"",

    "maintext": "Guided by ocean plankton fossils and climate models, scientists have calculated just how cold it got on Earth during the depths of the last Ice Age, when immense ice sheets covered large parts of North America, South America, Europe and Asia.\nThe average global temperature during the period known as the Last Glacial Maximum from roughly 23,000 to 19,000 years ago was about 7.8 C, some 7 C colder than 2019, the researchers said on Wednesday.\nCertain regions were much cooler than the global average, they found. The polar regions cooled far more than the tropics, with the Arctic region 14 C colder than the global average.\nThis global map shows the temperature differences compared to preindustrial times. Dark blue translates to cooler temperatures. The ice sheets of the past are superimposed on the continents. (Jessica Tierney/University of Arizona)\nThe researchers made their calculations with the aid of chemical measurements on tiny fossils of zooplankton and the preserved structures of fats from other types of plankton that change in response to water temperature \u2014 what they called a \"temperature proxy.\"\nThis information was then plugged into climate model simulations to calculate average global temperatures.\n\"Past climates are the only information we have about what really happens when the Earth cools or warms to a large degree. So by studying them, we can better constrain what to expect in the future,\" said University of Arizona paleoclimatologist Jessica Tierney, lead author of the research published in the journal Nature.\nDuring the Ice Age, which lasted from about 115,000 to 11,000 years ago, large mammals well adapted to a cold climate such as the mammoths, mastodons, woolly rhinos and sabre-toothed cats roamed the landscape.\nHumans entered North America for the first time during the Ice Age, crossing a land bridge that once connected Siberia to Alaska with sea levels much lower than they are today.\nSabre-toothed cat skeleton on display in the Royal Ontario Museum\u2019s Reed Gallery of the Age of Mammals. During the Ice Age, which lasted from about 115,000 to 11,000 years ago, large mammals well adapted to a cold climate roamed the landscape. (Wanda Dobrowlanski/Royal Ontario Museum)\nHuman hunting is believed to have contributed to mass extinctions globally of many species at the end of the Ice Age.\n\"What is interesting is that Alaska was not entirely covered with ice,\" Tierney said. \"There was an ice-free corridor that allowed humans to travel across the Bering Strait, into Alaska. Central Alaska was actually not that much colder than today, so for Ice Age humans it might have been a relatively nice place to settle.\"",

That\u2019s also a 30 per cent increase, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in an email Thursday.\n\u201cNASA has notified Congress of these new commitments, and we are working at the best possible pace toward launch, including streamlining operational flow at Kennedy and assessing opportunities to further improve the efficiency of our integration activities,\u201d Lueders wrote.\nThe new cost estimates are based on NASA\u2019s pledge to fly the first SLS-powered Artemis mission around the moon, without crew, in November 2021. Addressing the escalating costs, NASA referred to its previous statements on \u201cchallenges associated with design development, manufacturing development, first-time production, and initial operations for SLS.\u201d\nCoronavirus Uncertainty\nWhile the space agency is confident of meeting the November 2021 flight date, it\u2019s too early to predict the full impact of work delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Lueders said. NASA will follow the first SLS flight with a crewed mission in 2023. A third Artemis flight to put astronauts on the moon is planned for 2024 to meet a challenge set by the Trump administration.\n\u201cBoeing is responsible for the rocket core and upper stages and we are making great progress,\u201d the Chicago-based company said in a statement.\nJacobs Engineering Group Inc., the prime contractor for the ground support work at Kennedy Space Center, didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment.\nIn March, a NASA Inspector General report on the SLS program found that the agency has struggled with rising costs and delays, citing \u201cprogram management, technical issues, and contractor performance.\u201d By the end of the current U.S. fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, NASA will have spent more than US$17 billion on the overall SLS program, according to the report. That\u2019s 60 per cent more than NASA\u2019s 2014 cost estimate.\nThe next big test for the SLS, which will stand taller than the Statue of Liberty, will be in October when engineers plan to fire all four main RS-25 engines simultaneously and drain the fuel tanks within eight minutes, simulating flight conditions.\nNASA approved the rocket\u2019s development in August 2014, setting the cost at US$7.02 billion with a first flight \u201cno later than November 2018.\u201d Throughout its history, the SLS program has enjoyed immense support in the Senate, and Congress has continued to fund the program despite setbacks in cost and schedule.",

    "maintext": "Manitobans with COVID-19 and their close contacts could face fines of nearly $500 per day if they don't properly self-isolate after new public health orders come into effect Friday.\nIt was already mandatory to isolate in those situations and the province already has the power to fine people through a multiple-step process, Chief Provincial Public Health Officer Dr. Brent Roussin said on Thursday.\nBut the new orders will simplify that process by allowing officials to immediately fine people $486 daily if they break the rules.\nThe new rules come in response to some people in Manitoba not properly self-isolating when they should, including reports from the public suggesting some rule breakers spread the illness when they should have been in isolation, Roussin said at a news conference.\nSome of those reports involved cases later connected to a large cluster that infected people in Brandon, including people who went to large gatherings, he said.\nThat was one of the reasons the southwestern Manitoba city and the surrounding Prairie Mountain Health region were upgraded to the restricted level under the province's pandemic response system last week. The change meant people in the area have to wear face masks in public places and limit gatherings to 10 people, as of this past Monday.\n\"It was an important enough trend in this specific cluster that we saw that we just wanted to make sure we had something in place,\" Roussin said on Thursday.\nChief Provincial Public Health Officer Dr. Brent Roussin announced the new public health orders alongside Health Minister Cameron Friesen at a news conference on Thursday afternoon. (David Lipnowski/The Canadian Press)\nThe province has not made public all such incidences, but has identified the trend in the past.\nThe cluster in Brandon, for instance, began with someone who travelled to eastern Canada and did not properly self-isolate when they got back, Roussin said at the time.\nHe did not go into details of that particular case, but noted that self-isolation requires limiting contact with other people you live with.\nAnd in late June, health officials announced two of the province's recent cases of COVID-19 were people who travelled to the U.S. and Alberta, where they came into contact with a known case of the illness.\nWhen they got back, one of the travellers did not self-isolate for the required two weeks. One of them also visited a southeastern Manitoba business while they had symptoms of the illness, officials said at the time.\nUnder the current rules, the province can issue a communicable disease order to reprimand someone not self-isolating after being told to do so. That person would then have to violate the order, which would allow officials to apply for another order to detain the person, Roussin said. The new rules announced Thursday will get rid of that extra step.\n\"[Starting Friday,] rather than having to actually detain somebody, we could just \u2026 use that as a lever to say that you can be fined,\" he said.\nSome exceptions allowed\nPeople who need to self-isolate will be notified by public health officials they've either tested positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to the illness by a close contact of a confirmed case, Roussin said.\nWhen that happens, the person needs to go home, or to an approved self-isolating location, and stay there for 14 days or until public health officials tell them otherwise, he said.\nThe new protocols will be guided by medical officers of health, who will review each case of possible scofflaws, Roussin said, though officials will try to reason with people before slapping them with hefty fines.\n\"Education is our No. 1 tool here,\" he said. \"So for the most part, we're going to work with people to try to get them to self-isolate, support them [with] whatever they need to self-isolate. But there might be cases where we would issue this ticket.\"\nThere will be exceptions in some cases, like if someone told to self-isolate needs urgent medical attention or needs to go to an in-person appointment with a health-care provider, Roussin said.\nBut if a person is allowed to leave home under those circumstances, they need to wear a face mask, maintain physical distancing and spend minimal time away from the place where they're self-isolating, he said.\nOnce students return to schools in the province in early September, other exceptions to the new public health orders could come into play, Roussin said.\nFor example, if someone in a school cohort tests positive for COVID-19, all their close contacts will need to self-isolate. But everyone else in the group \u2014 which could be up to 75 people \u2014 won't necessarily need to do the same, he said.\n\"Public health will do that investigation. And so it could include that entire cohort, [but] we might be able to narrow it,\" Roussin said.",

    "maintext": "OTTAWA -- Just days before children return to school and adults return to work after summer vacation, Ottawa's top doctor is warning there are signs of another uptick of COVID-19 cases in Ottawa.\nBut Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches insists Ottawa residents can get through the spike in cases if everyone continues to do their part, including practicing physical distancing and wearing a mask indoors.\nOttawa Public Health reported 22 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, the fourth straight day with a double-digit increase in cases.\nSpeaking with CTV News Ottawa, Dr. Etches said Ottawa Public Health is seeing a concerning trend with new cases for the second time this summer.\n\"Well we're in a time right now where we're starting to see signs of another uptick in cases in Ottawa,\" said Dr. Etches Thursday afternoon.\n\"That happened in July where we saw cases rise again and they came back down as people adopted more mask wearing and reminded themselves about keeping two metres from others.\"\nDr. Etches added, \"So this is the world we're living in with rises and needing counter-measures. So just encourage everyone to keep doing their part, it does work. We will get through this together.\"\nOttawa Public Health has reported 354 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 so far in August.\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Etches told Council that Ottawa Public Health was seeing a \"different picture\" with how COVID-19 is spreading.\n\"The biggest risk factor for people is the close contacts that we have.\"\nOttawa Public Health statistics show that since Aug. 1, 57 per cent of COVID-19 cases for residents ages 10 and 19 years old and 44.6 per cent of COVID cases for residents ages 20 to 29 were linked to close contact with a confirmed case.\nForty per cent of all COVID-19 cases for residents ages 30 to 49 in August are linked to household contacts.\nSpeaking on CTV Morning Live Thursday morning, Dr. Etches said the fact close contacts are the driving factor behind a lot of new cases shows the importance of following the COVID-19 measures.\n\"It points to the effectiveness of the behaviours that we've adopted in public spaces. The effectiveness of staying away from people two metres and using a mask in indoor spaces,\" said Dr. Etches.\n\"We know that it's hard, we need close contact with others. It's still valuable to think about the fact this is a virus that can be passed on when people don't know that they're ill. The more we can do physical distancing and limit our contacts who have that kind of close contact with us, the better.\"\nOttawa Public Health reminds people that socializing and household spread are key risks for resurgence. The health unit reminds everyone to be COVID-wise\nW \u2013 Wear a mask\nI \u2013 Isolate yourself when you're sick\nS \u2013 Stay two metres apart from others\nE \u2013 Exercise proper hand hygiene",
